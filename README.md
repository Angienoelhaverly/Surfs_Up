# Surfs_Up
Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database. Design a Flask Application
## Project Purpose

## Goals
* Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database
* Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
* Design a Flask application using data.

## Why SQL Lite
SQL Lite is a version of SQL that lives on a computer or phone (local) so it's smaller, faster, and doesn't have users. SQL Lite is the most widely used database engine in the world. It is used in smart phones, computers, and applciations like ITunes and Photoshop. Local databases support quick testing and prototyping. So SQL Lite helps turn things around more quickly. SQLAlchemy is a query tool designed for SQL Lite and the integration of statistical analysis with dataframe analysis. To share our analysis, we will use Flask which is a webframework that uses Python to build web pages.
