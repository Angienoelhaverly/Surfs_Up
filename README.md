# Surfs_Up
Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database. Design a Flask Application
## Project Purpose
We have a business venture idea to open up a Surf 'n Shake shop that will serve ice cream and sell surfboards to locals and toursists in Hawaii. We need investor backing to start this venture. We've come up with our business proposal but our investor is concerned about the weather and we need to run analytics on a weather dataset for our business meeting. 

## Goals
* Use SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database
* Use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.
* Design a Flask application using data.

## Why SQL Lite
SQL Lite is a version of SQL that lives on a computer or phone (local) so it's smaller, faster, and doesn't have users. SQL Lite is the most widely used database engine in the world. It is used in smart phones, computers, and applciations like ITunes and Photoshop. Local databases support quick testing and prototyping. So SQL Lite helps turn things around more quickly. SQLAlchemy is a query tool designed for SQL Lite and the integration of statistical analysis with dataframe analysis. To share our analysis, we will use Flask which is a webframework that uses Python to build web pages allowing us to share our findings in real time.
